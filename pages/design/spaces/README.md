# Spaces

The spacings should be used via the CSS custom properties:

```css
.my-component {
  margin-left: var(--btcpay-space-m);
}
```

In addition to that there are also utility classes like `btcpay-space-x`, which apply the space as `margin-bottom`:

```html
<div class="btcpay-space-x">â€¦</div>
```
